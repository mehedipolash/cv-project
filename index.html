            <h3>C++</h3>
            <h5>It was my first experience learning a programming language.
            </h5>
            <p>C++ is a powerful and versatile programming language that serves as a cornerstone in the world of
              software development.
              Created by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language, C++ combines the efficiency
              and control of C
              with object-oriented programming features. This combination allows developers to write complex programs
              that are both
              high-performing and maintainable. C++ is widely used in various fields, including system/software
              development, game
              development, real-time simulation, and high-performance applications. Its rich library support and
              extensive community
              make it a go-to language for many programmers. Mastering C++ provides a deep understanding of fundamental
              programming
              concepts, such as memory management, pointers, and data structures, which are crucial for becoming a
              proficient software
              developer.</p>

            <br><br><br>


            <h3>Java,My-sql,data structure,algorithm</h3>
            <h5>one of my favourite programming language</h5>
            <p>Java is a widely-used, high-level programming language known for its portability, robustness, and ease of
              use. Developed
              by Sun Microsystems in the mid-1990s, Java was designed to have as few implementation dependencies as
              possible, making
              it an ideal choice for cross-platform applications. The "write once, run anywhere" (WORA) capability of
              Java means that
              code written in Java can run on any device equipped with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM), providing unmatched
              versatility.
              Java is extensively used in web development, mobile applications (particularly Android apps),
              enterprise-level
              applications, and big data technologies. Its object-oriented nature, comprehensive standard library, and
              strong
              community support make it a preferred language for both beginners and experienced developers. Mastering
              Java equips
              developers with the skills to create scalable, secure, and high-performing applications across a wide
              range of domains.</p>

            <br><br><br>


            <h3>C sharp,HTML,CSS,JAVACRIPT</h3>
            <h5>I also learned above things</h5>
            <p>C# is a modern, object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft as part of its .NET
              initiative. Known for
              its simplicity, scalability, and versatility, C# is widely used for developing Windows applications, web
              services, and
              games using the Unity game engine. Its strong typing, garbage collection, and rich standard library make
              it a robust and
              secure choice for developers.

              HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard language for creating and structuring content on the web.
              It provides
              the basic building blocks for web pages, allowing developers to define elements such as headings,
              paragraphs, links,
              images, and forms. HTML works in conjunction with CSS and JavaScript to create visually appealing and
              interactive
              websites.

              CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to control the presentation and layout of web
              pages. By
              separating content from design, CSS allows developers to apply styles, such as colors, fonts, and spacing,
              consistently
              across multiple web pages. This enhances the user experience and simplifies maintenance.

              JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that enables dynamic and interactive features
              on web pages.
              It is essential for front-end development, allowing developers to create responsive user interfaces,
              validate forms, and
              manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM). JavaScript is also used on the server-side with environments
              like Node.js,
              making it a versatile tool for full-stack development.</p>
